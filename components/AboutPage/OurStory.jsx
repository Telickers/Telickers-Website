        In a nutshell, we are a group of developers and designers who found that
        our skills are valuable. So we decided to merge our skills into one team
        having a structure and the motivation for researching, prototyping and
        building technology. That is how we got to build our team, and since
        then we have helped businesses, freelancers {"&"} companies reach their
        goals {"&"} improve their workflow.
